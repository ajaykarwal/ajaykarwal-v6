  title: I’m Level 1 Certified in Umbraco
---

Today I passed the Umbraco Certified Developer Level 1 course.

I’ve been working with Umbraco for about 5 months now so a lot of the material covered in the course was already familiar to me but it was extremely useful to learn some best practices for organising data types, document types and templates.

The two day course was held by Percipient Studios in Canary Wharf and I was one of 16 students. To be honest, the ten-question multiple choice test is ridiculously easy – they want you to pass - so it was just a case of paying attention to the workshop and ticking the right boxes.
