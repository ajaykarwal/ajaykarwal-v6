Here are some of the things I’m currently focused on. This page is inspired by Derek Siver’s [now page](http://sivers.org/now) suggestion and his [Now Now Now](http://nownownow.com/) movement.

**Last updated:** June 2018.

## Work
- I'm in the process of redesigning this site.
- In my day job, my focus is currently on UX, wireframing and rapid prototyping for a new ecommerce project I'm working on.

## Reading
I'm current reading [Think and Grow Rich](#) by Napoleon Hill.

Check out more of my recommended books on my [reading list](/reading-list/)

## Watching
- My wife and I are half way through season 2 of 13 Reasons Why. A bit slower than season 1 but a lot more focused on building the peripheral stories of each character.
- I plan on catching up on the original Blade Runner soon before checking out Blade Runner 2049 (bit late to the game I know).
