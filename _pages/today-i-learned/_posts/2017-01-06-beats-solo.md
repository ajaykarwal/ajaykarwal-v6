Today I learned that in order to pair a set of Beats Solo wireless headphones to Windows 10, you need to restart Windows to complete the setup!

Today I learned the basics of setting up a website using Jekyll. It only took about an hour to recreate about 50% of my existing portfolio website. Definitely something I'm going to invest more time in.

Today I learned what a Bias Light is. It's an ambient light which is placed behind a TV/Monitor to to reduce the strain on your eyes when watching TV in low light. It also helps to combat colour distortion casued by the ceiling lights of your living room.

The concept sounded cool so I order [this one](http://amzn.to/2k1hVrE).

Today I learned that you can download YouTube videos and playlists directly to a Synology NAS using the Synology Download Station [Chrome extension](https://www.download-station-extension.com/). The videos and playlist must be public or unlisted for this to work, which makes sense of course.

Today I learned that HTML emails in Outlook 2016 on Windows 10 are _still_ the worst thing ever! :neutral_face:

Today I learned that if you have [TRV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermostatic_radiator_valve)'s fitted on your radiators, at least one of the radiators in your house much have standard valves on it and these should be left fully open. This is to create a bypass in the event of all the TRV's being switched off or failing. Without this bypass, the boiler would start making a knocking sound and is likely to overheat.

It pays to talk to your British Gas engineer when they come over! :smile:
