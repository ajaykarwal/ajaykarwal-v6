Today I learned that if you have [TRV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermostatic_radiator_valve)'s fitted on your radiators, at least one of the radiators in your house much have standard valves on it and these should be left fully open. This is to create a bypass in the event of all the TRV's being switched off or failing. Without this bypass, the boiler would start making a knocking sound and is likely to overheat.

It pays to talk to your British Gas engineer when they come over! :smile:
