Makr is a community for creative people to connect and collaborate in the Thames Valley area. It's a Slack team where members can discuss events they've attended, find collaborators for side projects or simple form friendships with local people who have similar interests.

If you're in the Thames Valley area head over to <a href="http://www.makr.tv" target="_blank">www.makr.tv</a> and get an invite to the Slack team. Join in the conversations and help shape the future of Makr.

## Who is it for?

The project is still in its infancy so the direction it takes will very much depend on the people involved. So far there are some designers, developers, artists, writers, engineers and even recruiters on board.

I'm marketing Makr as a place for 'creative' people but it's open to anyone. The only condition being that you're based in (or around) the Thames Valley area. I believe that keeping the community focused to a specific region will improve the quality of the connections made.

## Why am I doing this?

For about two years now I've been attending local Meetup's and events geared towards design and development. By local I mean in and around Reading, which is situated within the [Thames Valley area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thames_Valley) – an area to the west of London which includes many of the towns that the River Thames runs through.

I'm not the most comfortable when it comes to networking and I was finding that I would attend events, hang out with the friends I went with, maybe start a conversation with the people immediately next to me, and then never follow up with any of the conversations that were started.

If the speakers shared their twitter handle I would follow them and maybe tweet at them after the event but that's about as far as it goes.

I started looking for any online communities of people in the local area and other than a handful of very specific Meetup groups, there was nothing. I found a bunch of Slack teams for designers and developers which I joined but I was finding that they were either too global or specific to London or San Fransisco. That's no good to me.

By now I'd pretty much decided in my own head that I was going to try and build a local community myself. I discussed the idea with a friend of mine - [@logo_geek](https://twitter.com/logo_geek) - while attending an event and he said he felt some of the same frustrations, thus validated my idea. A few back-and-forth twitter DM's later and the idea was born.
