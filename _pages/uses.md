I thought it would be interesting and somewhat useful to share a list of hardware, software, apps and other tools I use on a daily basis both at work and in my personal life.

The list is up to date as of October 2018.

## Hardware
I get by with a fairly lean set of hardware. I usually work at my desk at home or on the sofa so portability is key but as I dont travel much the weight of my computer is not that important.

### MacBook Pro
My primary computer at home is a **15" Retina Macbook Pro**. It's the late 2013 model and it was the top spec available at the time.
- 2.3 GHz Intel Core i7
- 16 GB 1600 MHz DDR3
- Intel Iris Pro 1536 MB
- 512 GB Flash Storage

I haven't had a need to upgrade to a newer model yet as most of my work doesn't involve any heavy processing power. I'm not a fan of the keyboard on the newer MacBooks and I'm not ready to give up MagSafe or my USB-A ports just yet.

### Phone
I currenly use 64GB iPhone 6S in gold. I've been an iPhone user since the iPhone 4 but no so much of a devotee to upgrade each year. I usually skip the 'S' models but I was so happy with my previous iPhone 5 that I decided to hold onto it for a little longer.

You can get an idea of my most used apps by checking out my [homescreen](https://imgur.com/gallery/xwsevGK).

### Headphones
My main set of heaphones are the **Beats by Dre Solo Wireless 2** in black and red version. The sound quality is brilliant, the battery lasts several days (based on my commute) and the size/weight doesn't weigh me down with extended use.

While they're not fully noise cancelling, they create enough of a vacuum to shut out surrounding conversations.

### Storage
At home I have a **[Synology DS212](http://amzn.to/2cYdXyb)** NAS drive (discontinued) hooked up to my network with 2 &times; **[3TB WD Red](http://amzn.to/2cKr2aX)** hard drives installed. I use it for backing up photos, sending and "receiving" large files and as a TimeMachine backup disc for my MacBook.

As for portable storage I have a couple of 1TB WD My Passport drives.

### Reading
I have a **[Kindle Fire HDX](http://amzn.to/2chJzcz)** 16GB version. I do prefer reading physical books whenever possible but the convenience of Kindle and the fact that I can keep in sync via my phone app makes it a winner. Have a look at some of my [book recomendations](/reading-list/).

## Software

### Text Editor

My code editor of choice is **Visual Studio Code**. It's fast, available on Mac and Windows and the library of available plugins is huge. 

I'm using the 'Material Theme Darker' theme with 'Operator Mono' font. It's a beautiful combination.

### Browser

**Google Chrome** is my browser of choice for browsing and developing. Of coure I have all other major browsers to hand for testing but the Dev Tools in Chrome are so far ahead of the curve compared to the others that I could probably never fully switch to another.

### Terminal

I'm not a particularly heavy command line user but I do prefer to use [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com) with a slighly customised theme. You can find my `profile.json` file [here](https://github.com/ajaykarwal/iterm-profile).

### Design Tools
I mainly use a combination of **Sketch**, **Photoshop** and **Illustrator** and export my design to **InVision** for prototyping.

I occasionally dabble in some photography and video editing so **Lightroom** and **Premiere Pro** are always installed on my machine too.


### Slack

I love **Slack**. I've worked in companies that exclusively use Skype for internal communication (or even worse, Skype for Business) and also tried out Microsoft Teams but the features and integrations with Slack - especially as a developer who needs to share code with others in a well formatted way - makes Slack the standout tool.


### Note Taking

I've rekindled my love for **[Evernote](http://www.evernote.com/)** since I started digitising all my physical paperwork which I'd been hoarding over the years. I use a combination of their [Scannable](https://evernote.com/products/scannable) app and browser extensions to pretty much organise everything in my life now.

### Cloud Storage

I keep all my day-to-day files and client work in a combination of Dropbox and Google Drive which are synced across all my computers. It's not perfect but it fits in best with the way I work. I use Box for more long-term archiving and dont have the Box folder synced to my computers.


## Podcasts

Pretty exhaustive list eh? I hope you found some useful resources on there. Feel free to [get in touch](/contact/) if you have any questions.

The concept for this list came from [Wes Bos](http://wesbos.com/uses/) and the format was inspired by [Harry Roberts](https://csswizardry.com/uses/) - you should check out their lists too.
