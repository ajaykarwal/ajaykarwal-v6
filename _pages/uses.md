I thought it would be interesting and somewhat useful to share a list of hardware, software, apps and other tools I use on a daily basis both at work and in my personal life.

The list is up to date as of April 2017.

## Hardware
I get by with a fairly lean set of hardware. I usually work at my desk at home or on the sofa so portability is key but as I dont travel much the weight of my computer is not that important.

### MacBook Pro
My primary computer at home is a **15" Retina Macbook Pro**. It's the late 2013 model and is was the top spec available at the time.
- 2.3 GHz Intel Core i7
- 16 GB 1600 MHz DDR3
- Intel Iris Pro 1536 MB
- 512 GB Flash Storage

I haven't had a need to upgrade to a newer model yet as most of my work doesn't involve any heavy processing power. I'm not a fan of the keyboard on the newer MacBooks and I'm not ready to give up MagSafe or my USB-A ports just yet.

### Phone
I currenly use 64GB iPhone 6S in gold. I've been an iPhone user since the iPhone 4 but no so much of a devotee to upgrade each year. I usually skip the 'S' models but I was so happy with my previous iPhone 5 that I decided to hold onto it for a little longer.

You can get an idea of my most used apps by checking out my [homescreen](http://homescreen.me/ajaykarwal).

### Headphones
My main set of heaphones are the **Beats by Dre Solo Wireless 2** in black and red version. The sound quality is brilliant, the battery lasts several days (based on my commute) and the size/weight doesn't weigh me down with extended use.

While they're not fully noise cancelling, they create enough of a vacuum to shut out surrounding conversations.

### Storage
At home I have a **[Synology DS212](http://amzn.to/2cYdXyb)** NAS drive (discontinued) hooked up to my network with 2 &times; **[3TB WD Red](http://amzn.to/2cKr2aX)** hard drives installed. I use it for backing up photos, sending and "receiving" large files and as a TimeMachine backup disc for my MacBook.

As for portable storage I have a couple of 1TB WD My Passport drives.

### Reading
I have a **[Kindle Fire HDX](http://amzn.to/2chJzcz)** 16GB version. I do prefer reading physical books whenever possible but the convenience of Kindle and the fact that I can keep in sync via my phone app makes it a winner. Have a look at some of my [book recomendations](/reading-list/).

## Software

### Sublime Text 3

My code editor of choice is **Sublime Text 3**. It's fast, available on Mac and Windows and the library of available plugins is huge. I don't have a lot of plugins installed for Sublime. The most important one though by far is **[Emmet](https://emmet.io/)**.

I'm using the [Cobalt2](https://github.com/wesbos/cobalt2) theme by Wes Bos becuase [friends don't let friends use Monokai](https://twitter.com/wesbos/status/794555918402732032) and I [sync my settings via GitHub](https://github.com/ajaykarwal/sublime-settings) which makes it handy when switching computers.

### Google Chrome

**Google Chrome** is my browser of choice for browsing and developing. Of coure I have all other major browsers to hand for testing but the Dev Tools in Chrome are so far ahead of the curve compared to the others that I could probably never fully switch to another.

### Terminal

I'm not a particularly heavy command line user so I stick with the stock macOS Terminal with a couple of small customisations.

### Adobe Creative Cloud

I've played about with **Sketch** and **Affinity Designer** but I feel most comfortable in **Photoshop** and **Illustrator**. 

I occasionally dabble in some photography and video editing so **Lightroom** and **Premiere Pro** are always installed on my machine too.

### Sketch

Only recently started using Sketch. As mentioned above, I'm an Adobe user but figured I would try and get another tool under my belt.

### Slack

I love **Slack**. I've worked in companies that exclusively use Skype for internal communication (or even worse, Skype for Business) and also tried out Microsoft Teams but the features and integrations with Slack - especially as dev who needs to share code with others in a well formatted way makes Slack the standout tool.

I also use Slack for a community side-project I've set up at [makr.tv](http://makr.tv). It's a community for creative people in the Thames Valley (UK) area - Go check it out.

### Note Taking

I use Markdown for drafting notes and writing blog posts and **[Typora](http://www.typora.io/)** is a brilliant app for this. It's available for Mac and PC and has a super clean interface. I save my `.md` files to Dropbox so they're available everywhere and use [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer/) when editing them on my phone.

### Dropbox

It's not perfect but it fits in best with the way I work. I also have my iPhone camera roll automatically back up to Dropbox so I don't have to fiddle with iTunes to get photos onto my computer.

### Accounting

I use **[Crunch Accounting](http://www.crunch.co.uk/referrals/?c2c=ak16891e)** for managing my freelance work accounts. A brilliant service which, although more expensive than other online accounting services such as Xero, Cruch comes with a dedicated accountant and takes care of all the HMRC stuff which everyone hates! You should definitely check it out!

Pretty exhaustive list eh? I hope you found some useful resources on there. Feel free to [get in touch](/contact/) if you have any questions.

The concept for this list came from [Wes Bos](http://wesbos.com/uses/) and the format was inspired by [Harry Roberts](https://csswizardry.com/uses/) - you should check out their lists too.
