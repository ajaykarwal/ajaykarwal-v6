I am a **user interface designer** and **front-end developer** with over {{ site.time|date:'%Y'|abs|minus:2002 }} years experience in branding, design and development focusing on pixel-perfect interfaces built with clean readable code. Husband, father and an avid reader of the internetâ€”this is my home.

I'm currently working as **Front-end Developer** at <a href="http://www.ecx.io" target="_blank" title="ecx.io - Creating Digital Success">ecx.io</a>, a digital agency based in Bracknell, UK. Aside from that, you'll find me <a href="http://www.twitter.com/ajaykarwal" target="_blank" title="Follow me on Twitter">tweeting my thoughts</a> or buried in a <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/ajaykarwal" target="_blank" title="My Goodreads profile">good book</a>.

## Experience
After graduating from Kingston University in 2003 I've steadily built my career, transitioning from designer to front-end developer, whilst working on a number of small yet ambitious startups under the umbrella of my co-founded company, Prama.


Since exiting Prama in 2013, I have built on these foundations in both a freelance and agency capacity with clients include BP, Heineken, Thames Water, Audi, Brother, HSBC, BT, Caterpillar, Ministry of Sound, Kodak, WHSmith, and BSi.


## Development
I specialise in UI development though my experience in multiple fields allows me to approach project from many angles. These skills include - but are not limited to:

- HTML5
- CSS3 / Sass / Less
- JavaScript / jQuery / ReactJS
- Gulp / Grunt / Webpack / NPM / Node
- Wordpress / Bootstrap / Jekyll

I'm also comfortable working with back-end development in ASP.NET, PHP and Java, as well as all the tools necessary to manage deployment, version control, debugging and performance.

Here is a list of the [tools I use on a regular basis](/uses/).


## Creative
Starting my career as a designer I've built up expert knowledge of **Adobe Creative Cloud** as well as more UI specific tools such as **Sketch** and **InVision**. As a keen photographer and music lover I am able to utilise these passions to bring an extra layer of creativity to a project - beyond the bounds of simply designing websites.


I'm a member of a number of creative platforms such as <a href="http://www.behance.net/ajaykarwal" target="_blank" title="My Behance profile">Behance</a> and <a href="http://www.dribbble.com/ajaykarwal" target="_blank" title="My Dribbble profile">Dribbble</a> and always keep my finger on the pulse of the latest design trends. I'm passionate about typography, colour harmony and composition and aim to apply tried and tested design principles to create engaging user experiences.
