  title:  Nokia 3310
---

Today I learned that (according to GSM Arena) the original [Nokia 3310 weighed less than an iPhone 7](http://www.gsmarena.com/compare.php3?idPhone1=192&idPhone2=8064). Surprising considering it was 15.1mm thicker and generally felt like a bit of a brick in hindsight.

Of course, the [2017 model](http://www.techradar.com/reviews/new-nokia-3310-2017-review) has a much slimmer profile and weighs about half as much as the original. Carphone Warehouse have a [pre-order](https://www.carphonewarehouse.com/nokia/pre-registration.html) page up at the moment and for the rumoured Â£41 price tag is a small price to pay for a little bit of nostalgia... and Snake of course :snake:
