  title:  Download YouTube videos to a Synology NAS
---

Today I learned that you can download YouTube videos and playlists directly to a Synology NAS using the Synology Download Station [Chrome extension](https://www.download-station-extension.com/). The videos and playlist must be public or unlisted for this to work, which makes sense of course.

Videos are downloaded in `.mp4` format and are named based on the video title. If you're downloading a playlist, all the individual videos are placed within a folder which takes the playlists name.

The few that I tested with are downloaded at 24fps with the resolution being the max available for that video. This [4K sample video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8JteDwu7hw) downloaded at 2160p @ 23fps with 44kHz 125kbps audio.
