I'm not entirely sure when or why - I must have subconsciously been taking in all the references while on Behance - but I decided to pick up a copy of Making Ideas Happen by Scott Belsky, CEO and founder of Behance.net.

The book focuses on how to push your creative ideas forward and shares insights from some of the creative world's top individuals. Scott talks about organisational skills through the use of action steps; harnessing the forces of your community and building upon your leadership skills.

While reading Making Ideas Happen, I noticed a lot of traits in myself and my fellow co-founders of Prama - in particular the section about Dreamers, Doers and Incrementalist (myself being the Dreamer). I've noticed a subtle change in the way I approach my daily task list and the way I write down my action steps. I've even started creating a list of back burner items to refer to later.

Overall, I would highly recommend Making Ideas Happen to anyone who is looking to channel their creativity to either launch a new project of their own, or just streamline the way they manage the projects they already work on.
