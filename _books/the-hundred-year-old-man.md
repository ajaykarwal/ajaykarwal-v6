Funny, clever and full of politics.

A little too long and sometimes the 'flashback' chapters of Allan's life tend to drag on a bit but the importance of their context all comes together nicely towards the end.

I like the way the chapters are constructed in an almost circular fashion so that the book pretty much ends back where it started.

~~I think this would make a great movie~~ This was also a pretty decent <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2113681/" target="_blank">movie</a>.
