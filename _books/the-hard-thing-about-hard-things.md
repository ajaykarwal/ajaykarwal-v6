The hard thing about hard things deals with the trials that Ben Horowitz encountered during his career as founder CEO to VC at Andreessen Horowitz. The book gives practical advice on how to grow a company, find the right executives, and deal with the hard decisions along the way.

The first half of the book mainly covers Horowitz's back story and it takes a while for anything of real value to be mentioned. By the halfway mark though the book offers plenty of bookmark-worthy snippets of advice - such as what makes a <a href="{{site.baseurl}}{% link _posts/2016-06-21-product-manager.md %}" title="Good Product Manager; Bad Product Manager">good product manager and a bad product manager</a> - which should be relevant to anyone who is looking to develop a career in leadership.

It's very likely I will be referring to this book again in the future.
