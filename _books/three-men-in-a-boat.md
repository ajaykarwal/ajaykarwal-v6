I found this book in one of those ‘<a href="http://www.stylist.co.uk/books/top-50-free-books-for-your-ereader" target="_blank" title="50 best free books on Kindle - Stylist.co.uk">top 50 free books</a> you have to download' type of lists. I didn't really have any idea what to expect from it.

The book follows the tales of three men (and a dog) who decide to take a fortnight's trip sailing up the Thames from Kingston to Oxford. Now, sailing isn't really my number one choice of subject but the wittiness and idiocy of some of the events that take place soon got me hooked.

I suppose what made _Three Men In A Boat_ more appealing to me personally is the fact that I currently live in Berkshire and the journey cuts through some of my neighbouring towns such as Windsor, Datchet, Cookham, Maidenhead and Reading. It was a pleasure to read about these towns from the point-of-view of those who are simply there to take in the scenery—although Maidenhead wasn't really let off lightly!

A great read and highly recommended.

Makes me want to hire a boat.
