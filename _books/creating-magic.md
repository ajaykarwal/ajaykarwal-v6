A really enjoyable read with some fantastic tips on becoming a better leader. Most of the points mentioned are straight forward common sense (as the title of the book suggests) but the references to how they were implemented at Disney really reinforces them.

Although all the examples mentioned in the book relate to the hospitality industry (hotels, restaurants and theme parks) they can be applied to pretty much any business model.

Highly recommended for anyone who is / aspires to be a leader.
