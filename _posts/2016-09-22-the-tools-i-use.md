I thought it would be interesting and somewhat useful to share a list of hardware, software, apps and podcasts I use on a daily basis both at work and in my personal life.

The list is up to date as of September 2016.



## Hardware

- **HP Probook 6570b** laptop with a **Dell U2711** screen at work. The laptop wouldn't have been my first choice but it's the machine I was provided with. The screen is pretty decent.
- [**Logitech MK710**](http://amzn.to/2cY04Qs) keyboard and mouse combo. Easily on of the best PC combo sets I've ever used.


- **15" Retina Macbook Pro** at home. It's the late 2013 model and is was the top spec at the time.
- **Apple Magic Mouse**. I have a love/hate relationship with this mouse.
- **iPhone 6S** 64GB in gold.
- **Beats by Dre Solo Wireless 2** headphones - the black and red version.
- **[Synology DS212](http://amzn.to/2cYdXyb)** NAS drive (discontinued) with **[3TB WD Red](http://amzn.to/2cKr2aX)** hard drive installed. I have this hooked up to my network at home and use it for backing up photos, sharing large files and as a TimeMachine backup disc for my Macbook.
- **[Kindle Fire HDX](http://amzn.to/2chJzcz)** 16GB version.



## Software

### Development

- **Visual Studio 2015**. I work in a .NET agency building websites in Umbraco and EPiServer so it's necessary to work with the Microsoft stack.
- **Sublime Text 3** for quick code editing where it's not necessary to fire up a fully loaded IDE. I also mainly use Sublime when I'm working on WordPress projects. I don't have a lot of plugins installed for Sublime. The most important one though by far is **Emmet**.
- **[CodeKit](https://incident57.com/codekit/)** for quick environment setup and for compiling Sass (Mac only).
- **Google Chrome**. It's my browser of choice and the Dev Tools are a million times better than all the other browsers.
- There's a whole bunch of other small utilities such as **Gulp** and **NPM** which would make this list far too long. I wont go into them all but I tend to try out anything which speeds up workflow and efficiency.

### Design

- **Adobe CC**. I've played about with **Sketch** and **Affinity Designer** but I feel most comfortable in **Photoshop** and **Illustrator**. I use **Premiere Pro** for video editing.

### Misc

- **Slack** for team communication. I also use Slack for the community I've set up at www.makr.tv - Go check it out.
- **[Typora](http://www.typora.io/)** - a Markdown editor for Mac and PC - for drafting notes and blog posts such as this one. It's a great app with a super clean interface. I sync my `.md` files to Dropbox. I'm hoping they release a mobile app soon and introduce native syncing.
- **[Dropbox](https://db.tt/KkOb2qj6)**. It's not perfect but it fits in best with the way I work. I also have my iPhone camera roll automatically back up to Dropbox so I don't have to fiddle with iTunes to get photos onto my computer.
- **Filezilla** for FTP. It's free. It does the job.
- **[Tweeten](http://tweeten.xyz/)** for twitter. It's a wrapper for Tweetdeck with some additional improvements which means Tweetdeck features can be used on the desktop again. It's also cross platform.
- **Wunderlist** for to-do lists. Mainly used to share lists with my wife such as shopping, household chores and planning holidays.
- **[Trello](https://trello.com/ajaykarwal/recommend)** for task management. We heavily use Trello at work with boards set up for each of our projects. We're going through a bit of a transition period at the moment, testing out various 'power ups' to improve our workflow.
- **Buffer** for times when I have a lot of things to share on twitter but don't want to bombard my feed.
- **[Pocket](https://getpocket.com)** for saving links for later. I used to do all my saving and notes in Evernote but since they introduced the two device limit I've made the switch to using Pocket and Typora.
- **[Crunch Accounting](http://www.crunch.co.uk/referrals/?c2c=ak16891e)** for managing my freelance work accounts. A brilliant service you should definitely check out!
- **[AIMP](http://www.aimp.ru/)** for playing music on Windows. It's based on the now discontinued Winamp, which was my favourite music player app ever.
- **[VOX](http://coppertino.com/)** for playing music on Mac. It's about the closest thing on Mac there is to Winamp.

## Other random bits

The rest are things which don't really fit into any particular category.

- **[Behance Dot Grid Book](http://amzn.to/2cKA8Vc)** for sketching and wireframing. The quality of the paper is amazing and it looks great too. Sometimes I also use a simple **[Pukka Pad squared paper notebook](http://amzn.to/2cYkOb7)**.
- **[Zebra Drafix Mechanical Pencil](http://amzn.to/2cCp68B)** - 0.5mm. Nothing special about it really.
- **[PaperMate Flair](http://amzn.to/2cCoW0S)** felt tip pens.
- **[Copic Ciao Grey Tone](http://amzn.to/2cYltJi)** makers.
- **[Spider Bottle Protein Shaker](http://amzn.to/2cYEk7e)**. This is a brilliant shaker which always gives a smooth blend. It's got a spring inside which expands and contracts as you shake. Also it comes with two additional portioning sections and an insert for supplement pills, if you're taking things very seriously!
