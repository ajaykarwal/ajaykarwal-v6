  title:  People really love Nintendo
---

Today I learned that if you put an old Super Nintendo for sale on Gumtree and undervalue it, your phone and emails will go into over-drive for the rest of the day. I never knew that they were so sought-after!

Anyway, so I start talking to one of the collector/dealers that contacted me and he told me about the ridiculous money that some people are willing to pay for old SNES games.

p.s. The SNES and Nintendo 64 looks terrible on a 50" 4K TV :-1:
